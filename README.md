# Disambiguating the role of noise correlations when decoding neural populations together

One of the most important questions in neural coding is what role noise correlations play in neural decoding, and more precisely, whether noise correlations must be taken into account for constructing optimal decoders. To that end, many measures have been proposed to quantify the information that is lost when noise correlations are ignored. In this work, I show that these measures have some rather unusual features. Turns out that, according to these measures, noise correlations that are irrelevant when decoding populations in isolation become relevant when decoding them together, even if the populations constitute independent channels of information. This observation opens up questions about the validity of the measures and provides insights into new possiblities for decoding optimally under the assumptions of noise independence.
